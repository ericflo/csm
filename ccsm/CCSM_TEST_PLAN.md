# CCSM C++ Test Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the CCSM C++ codebase. Following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, these tests are designed to define the desired behavior while the current implementation is just a placeholder.

| GGML Subsystem | 85%+ | 游리 Partial | High |
| MLX Acceleration | 80%+ | 游댮 Not Started | Medium |
| Generator | 90%+ | 游댮 Not Started | High |
| Watermarking | 85%+ | 游댮 Not Started | Medium |
| Command-line Arguments | 90%+ | 游댮 Not Started | Medium |
| Utility Functions | 85%+ | 游댮 Not Started | Low |

## Coverage Measurement Process

1. Build with coverage instrumentation:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh --coverage
   ```

2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   cd build && ctest -V
   ```

3. Generate coverage report:
   ```bash
   cd build && make coverage
   ```

4. View coverage report:
   ```bash
   open build/coverage/index.html
   ```

## Mock Implementation Guidelines

1. Create minimal implementations that satisfy interfaces
2. Focus on verification not actual functionality
3. Use controlled inputs and outputs
4. Document expected behavior clearly
5. Match const-correctness with real interfaces
6. Provide clear error messages when mocks are used incorrectly

## TDD Implementation Process

1. Write failing tests that define expected behavior
2. Ensure tests compile but fail with current placeholders
3. Document expected behavior in test comments
4. Implement the minimal code to make tests pass
5. Refactor while maintaining passing tests
6. Repeat for next component/feature

## Progress Tracking

This document will be updated regularly as tests are implemented and coverage goals are met. Each component will be marked as:

- 游댮 Not Started
- 游리 Partial
- 游릭 Complete

Regular coverage reports will be generated to track progress toward coverage goals.
