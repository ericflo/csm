## Development Philosophy

CCSM follows a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach:

1. Write tests that define expected behavior
2. Implement minimal code to make tests pass
3. Refactor for performance and clarity
4. Measure coverage and identify gaps
5. Repeat until all features are implemented

This approach ensures robust, well-tested code with high test coverage.

## Implementation Plan

### Priority Order

1. **Core Tensor System** - Foundation for all operations
2. **GGML Backend** - CPU-based tensor operations
3. **Model System** - Transformer model implementation
4. **Tokenizer** - Text and audio tokenization
5. **Generator** - Text-to-audio pipeline
6. **Watermarking** - Audio watermarking
7. **MLX Acceleration** - Apple Silicon optimizations
8. **Utility functions and CLI args** - Supporting infrastructure

### Implementation Process

For each component, follow this workflow:

1. Run existing tests to identify failing tests
2. Implement just enough code to make tests pass
3. Add more tests for additional functionality
4. Implement that functionality
5. Refactor for performance while keeping tests passing
6. Measure coverage and add tests for uncovered areas

## Testing Strategy

CCSM follows a comprehensive testing strategy with multiple test types:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
3. **Performance Tests**: Test performance metrics and optimizations
4. **Edge Case Tests**: Test behavior under extreme conditions

### Test Design Principles

- Tests should define behavior, not implementation details
- Tests should be independent and reproducible
- Tests should cover both success and failure cases
- Tests should include performance benchmarks where appropriate

## Testing Infrastructure

- **Framework**: Google Test
- **Coverage Analysis**: LCOV/GCOV
- **Coverage Reports**: HTML reports via custom scripts
- **Test Runners**: CTest with custom scripts for coverage

## Running Tests

### Basic Test Execution

```bash
# Build the project
./build.sh

# Run tests using CTest
cd build && ctest
```

### Running Tests with Coverage

```bash
# Build with coverage instrumentation
./build.sh --coverage

# Run all tests with coverage
./scripts/run_tests_with_coverage.sh

# Run specific tests with coverage
./scripts/run_tests_with_coverage.sh "TensorTest.*"

# Generate HTML report
./scripts/run_tests_with_coverage.sh --html
```

### Viewing Coverage Reports

- Basic coverage reports: `build/coverage_*/index.html`
- Detailed analysis report: `coverage_report/index.html`

## Current Implementation Issues

### Watermarking Tests âœ…
- âœ… The `WatermarkResult` struct is referenced in tests but not defined in the header
- âœ… Solution: Define the struct in watermarking.h (implemented)

### GGML Functions
- Missing `ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx` function used in `ggml_model.cpp`
- Solution: Update the GGML backend to include this function

### Integration Tests
