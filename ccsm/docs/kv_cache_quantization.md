# KV Cache Quantization in CCSM

This document explains the implementation and optimization of KV cache quantization in CCSM.

## Overview

KV cache quantization reduces memory usage during inference by storing the key and value tensors in a lower precision format. This is essential for reducing the memory footprint when generating long sequences, as the KV cache grows linearly with sequence length.

## Implementation Details

### Quantization Methods

CCSM implements multiple quantization schemes for the KV cache:

1. **Q8_0**: 8-bit quantization with zero bias
   - Each float is represented by an 8-bit integer
   - Uses a scale factor to map between float and int8 ranges
   - Memory reduction: 4x compared to FP32

2. **Q4_0**: 4-bit quantization with zero bias
   - Each float is represented by a 4-bit integer
   - Uses a scale factor shared across blocks of values
   - Memory reduction: 8x compared to FP32

3. **Q4_1**: 4-bit quantization with non-zero bias
   - Each float is represented by a 4-bit integer plus bias
   - More accurate than Q4_0 for distributions that aren't centered at zero
   - Memory reduction: 8x compared to FP32 (with minimal overhead for bias)

### Implementation

The quantization process involves:

1. Computing the range of values in a block
2. Calculating appropriate scaling factors
3. Converting float values to quantized values
4. Storing quantization parameters for dequantization

Dequantization uses SIMD instructions where available for fast conversion back to floating point during inference.

## Optimization Techniques

### Block-based Quantization

Values are quantized in blocks (typically 32 or 64 elements) to:
- Optimize for SIMD processing
- Maintain better accuracy by adapting quantization parameters per block
- Enable more efficient memory access patterns

### SIMD Acceleration

The implementation leverages SIMD instructions:
- AVX2/AVX-512 on x86 architectures
- NEON on ARM architectures
- Specifically optimized kernels for Apple Silicon

### Asymmetric Quantization

For Q4_1, we use asymmetric quantization:
- Stores both scale and zero-point for each block
- Better handles asymmetric distributions common in attention matrices
- Provides better accuracy for the same bit width

## Memory-Compute Tradeoffs

Different quantization methods offer different tradeoffs:

| Method | Memory Saving | Accuracy Impact | Compute Overhead |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Q8_0   | 4x            | Very Low        | Low              |
| Q4_0   | 8x            | Moderate        | Low              |
| Q4_1   | 8x            | Low             | Low-Moderate     |

## Integration with GGML

The KV cache quantization integrates with GGML backend:

1. Custom compute kernels for quantized operations
2. Optimized memory management for the quantized cache
3. Transparent API that automatically handles dequantization when needed

## Results

Our benchmarks show:

- Up to 8x memory reduction with minimal accuracy impact
- Negligible performance impact on generation speed
- Ability to handle much longer context lengths with the same memory budget

## Configuration Options

Users can control quantization behavior:

```cpp
// Example configuration
ggml_params.set_kv_cache_quantization(
    ggml::QuantizationType::Q4_1,  // Quantization type
    32,                            // Block size
    true                           // Use SIMD acceleration
);
```

## Future Improvements

Planned improvements include:

1. Support for more quantization types (Q3_K, Q2_K)
2. Dynamic switching between quantization methods based on content
3. Further SIMD optimizations for newer instruction sets
4. Quantization-aware training for models
