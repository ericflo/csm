# Implementation Details

Reimplementing Moshi from scratch would require careful attention to engineering and correctness. In this section, we outline practical considerations: code structure, libraries, training regimen, and debugging techniques. We assume one has access to high-level descriptions (as above) and possibly the open-source repository as a reference. We’ll focus on how an expert might go about building Moshi’s components, validating them, and optimizing performance.

##  Code Structure and Frameworks

Kyutai’s implementation of Moshi is in PyTorch (with some Rust and MLX variants for deployment) ([Moshi open-source release: run Moshi locally!](https://kyutai.org/2024/09/18/moshi-release.html#:~:text=Today%2C%20we%20release%20several%20Moshi,in%20PyTorch%2C%20Rust%20and%20MLX)). A logical code structure might break the model into the following classes/modules:

- `HeliumModel` (or reuse an existing transformer decoder class): This would be configured with `n_layers=32, d_model=4096, n_heads=32, d_ff=11264`, RMSNorm, RoPE, etc., matching Helium. One could inherit from a GPT-Neo or LLaMA model class in HuggingFace and just adjust layer sizes and activation functions (HuggingFace’s integration mentions similarity to their `Gemma` model, which is likely an internal name) ([Moshi](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/moshi#:~:text=1,in%20the%20paper)). The tokenizer (SentencePiece) can be handled via the `sentencepiece` Python library or HuggingFace’s `AutoTokenizer` if the model is added to the hub.

- `MimiCodec` class: This would include `MimiEncoder` and `MimiDecoder` submodules and implement `encode(audio_waveform) -> audio_tokens` and `decode(audio_tokens) -> waveform`. There is a HuggingFace `MimiModel` that likely does exactly this encoding/decoding pipeline ([kyutai/mimi · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/mimi#:~:text=Mimi%20is%20a%20high,end%20fashion)) ([kyutai/mimi · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/mimi#:~:text=Use%20the%20following%20code%20to,install%20the%20required%20Python%20packages)). An implementer can study Meta’s `EncodecModel` in the audiocraft library as a starting point, then incorporate the modifications (extra Transformer, semantic distillation). For training from scratch, one would need a dataset of raw audio and the WavLM model to distill from (WavLM-Large is available from Microsoft). Losses for mel spectrogram and adversarial require integrating a multi-scale discriminator – the Facebook Audiocraft repository provides a good template for that, as it implements SoundStream/EnCodec training.

- `DepthTransformer` class: A custom Transformer decoder that has cross-attention to a provided context vector. Alternatively, one can implement it as a decoder where the “encoder keys/values” are just one vector (z_s) repeated or projected. In code, you could hack this by setting up an encoder with one token, but easier is to implement an attention mechanism that concatenates z_s to the self-attention context. Given its small size, this is not too complex. Each Depth generation step is short (≤8 tokens), so it might be acceptable to loop through generating each token. HuggingFace’s approach possibly unrolls it as a single forward with causal mask (since generate() can handle up to fixed length K easily).

- `MoshiModel` wrapper: This would tie Helium and Depth together. For training, one would probably write a custom forward that takes in a batch of data structured as (text_tokens, user_audio_tokens, moshi_audio_tokens) and computes the joint loss. The forward pass might do:

  1. Embed the inputs for the previous time steps (taking user tokens and moshi tokens from time 0 to s-1 as context) for Helium.
  2. Run Helium to get z_s for current step (or rather run it for all time steps in sequence if training with teacher-forcing – possibly they unroll the entire sequence using teacher forcing across time).
  3. Feed each z_s and the ground-truth audio tokens at time s into Depth to get logits for those tokens.
  4. Compute loss.
     This can be done sequentially for each time or using clever masking to do it in parallel. In fact, one could fold time into batch dimension for training to parallelize, but managing the state might be hard. The paper suggests they might treat each time step as sequential in training as well, which is slower. However, since they did 1M steps of pretraining, probably they found a way to parallelize across time to some extent. The RQ-Transformer paper (Lee et al. 2022) might have techniques for that. Alternatively, they may simply treat the entire conversation as one long sequence of tokens (with an ordering that places codebook tokens after each time’s text token) and train it like a standard LM – this would be simpler code-wise (no special training loop), but you’d have to pad tokens to align and do masking to prevent mis-ordering. Actually, one can do this: flatten the sequence in order: for s from 0 to S:
     - Insert Moshi text token (if any) with certain mask,
     - Insert Moshi semantic token,
     - Insert Moshi acoustic tokens,
     - Insert user semantic token,
     - Insert user acoustic tokens.
       Then apply a custom attention mask that ensures tokens at time s only attend to tokens ≤ s and, within time s, each acoustic token attends earlier ones (so a block of masks). This is a single sequence training. The complexity is constructing that mask and indexing embeddings properly. The authors likely did something along those lines. They denote formulas in the paper for stacking sub-sequences and applying masks ([](https://kyutai.org/Moshi.pdf#:~:text=Vs%2C2%20%3D%20As%2C1%20semantic%20tokens,Vs%2C1%2BQ%2B1%20%3D%20A%E2%80%B2%20s%2C1)).

  In implementation terms, doing a single sequence would allow using standard Transformer implementations if you can pass a custom attention mask matrix of shape (T_total, T_total). But T_total (like 30k for 5 min audio) might be large to handle as one sequence with full attention, which defeats the purpose of the hierarchy. So perhaps they did not flatten fully, they truly used the two-transformer approach in code. They might run the Temporal transformer across S steps (which is like running an RNN or using caching in autoregressive loop because each step depends on the last). In training, they might not backprop through the entire unrolled 30k length due to memory – they might use truncated BPTT or treat each step independently except through hidden state (which in a Transformer is complicated – you can’t easily get hidden state without running from start anyway). It’s intricate. For a reimplementation, one might simplify by training it as a standard LM on a flattened representation with masking. Given that HuggingFace has a conversion, they likely flattened the positional encoding scheme or used some trick.

- **Libraries and Dependencies:**
  - PyTorch for model building and training.
  - HuggingFace Transformers could be used to quickly get a GPT model for Helium and then modify it.
  - SentencePiece for tokenizer.
  - For audio: `torchaudio` can load audio files, and could compute mel-spectrograms for loss.
  - The adversarial training would need a discriminator: possibly reuse the MultiScaleDiscriminator from torchaudio or audiocraft.
  - WavLM model for distillation (the HF hub has `microsoft/wavlm-large`).
  - FlashAttention: can be integrated via the `flash_attn` library or using PyTorch 2.0’s scaled_dot_product_attention (though that might not be as fast for long sequences).
  - Opting for BitsandBytes (8-bit weights) for inference can reduce mem usage on GPU.

Given complexity, one might not train from scratch but use Kyutai’s weights. But an expert implementing from scratch might test pieces individually (e.g. train Mimi alone first, then freeze it; train Helium or use an existing LM like LLaMA as Helium if they want to shortcut, etc.).

##  Validation and Testing

Implementing such a model requires extensive testing at each stage:

- **Unit tests for Mimi:** After training Mimi codec, one should verify that encoding+decoding yields audio close to original (subjectively and via metrics like PESQ or STOI). One can also encode some speech and listen to confirm quality, and that the compression matches expected bitrate (e.g. ensure output tokens length = 12.5 Hz, code usage across quantizers looks reasonable). If implementing WavLM distillation, one can verify that the first quantizer’s output is predictive of phonetic content by doing an ABX test as they did ([](https://kyutai.org/Moshi.pdf#:~:text=Mimi,based%20ABX%20%28Schatz%20et%20al)) or simply checking that feeding the tokens into a KNN classifier on phoneme labels yields high accuracy.

- **Transformer integration tests:** Helium alone can be validated by ensuring it can overfit a small corpus (say a few sample texts) and produce sensible text. Also, one might load existing LLaMA-7B weights into Helium’s architecture (since it’s nearly the same) to verify the code works with known outputs. Depth Transformer can be unit-tested on synthetic data: for example, fix a random context vector and train Depth to output a known pattern of tokens – see if it can learn to do that.

- **End-to-end no-audio testing:** Before integrating audio, one might test Moshi in a text-only mode. If we remove Mimi and treat it purely as a text generator (like just chat with Helium), does that part function? Helium after pretraining should produce fluent text. Then gradually add audio: e.g. fix a simple codec (maybe a trivial one-hot per letter spoken) to test multi-stream mechanism.

- **Overfit a toy conversation:** A good debugging step is to create a very short synthetic “conversation” (like one or two time steps) and train Moshi to reproduce it. For instance: user says “Hello” (maybe 1 second of audio), Moshi replies “Hi”. Construct a single training example where user audio tokens correspond to some fixed pattern, Moshi audio tokens correspond to another fixed pattern. Train for a while to see if model learns to output those tokens when prompted with user’s. This ensures the multi-stream forwarding and loss are correct.

- **Performance testing:** Ensure that the iterative generation can actually run in real-time. For instance, simulate streaming by feeding audio from a file to the model and measure latency. Optimize any bottlenecks (maybe use caching for Helium’s KV states across time steps so you don’t recompute all previous attention at each step – Transformers support caching key/values for past tokens in autoregressive generation; Helium in inference mode will use that to only compute new attention for new step, which is critical).

- **Debugging techniques:** Visualization can help – for example, one can track attention weights of Helium to see if it focuses appropriately on recent tokens vs older; or check the distribution of predicted audio tokens – if Moshi is spitting out the same audio token repeatedly, something’s wrong. Also, monitor the loss for each component: perhaps log the text token loss separately from audio token loss to ensure the model isn’t ignoring one. Using small portions of real speech data (like just 1 minute from Fisher) to train a tiny model can reveal if the data formatting is correct (does loss decrease, do generated tokens match patterns, etc.).

Because Moshi is generative and multi-modal, qualitative testing (listening to outputs) is crucial. For example, after training on synthetic scripts, play back a generated conversation: does it align with expectations? If Moshi starts speaking before user even speaks or talks over itself, maybe the training or streaming scheduling has an issue.

##  Dependencies and Engineering Challenges

**Memory management:** Training with 4.2M token text batches and 16h audio batches is huge. They likely used gradient accumulation and multi-node training. An implementer might not replicate those sizes; one could scale down (e.g. 1M tokens, 1h audio per batch on 8 GPUs). Using mixed precision (fp16 or bfloat16) is a must. For inference, as noted, quantization could be applied (though the official PyTorch version hasn’t, one could apply 4-bit quant to Helium using something like GPTQ if needed, at some quality cost).

**Synchronization of streams:** One tricky part of implementation is ensuring that the user and system token streams remain time-synchronized during generation. The model expects inputs aligned. In a streaming loop, this means you can’t let the model get too far ahead or behind. For example, if user hasn’t said anything for some steps, you may be feeding “blank” user tokens (maybe zeros or a special silence token) to keep step count equal ([Moshi](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/moshi#:~:text=1,are%20synchronized%20with%20the%20audios)). The HF guidance suggests padding with zeros for absence of user input ([Moshi](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/moshi#:~:text=You%20can%20dynamically%20use%20the,what%20you%20want%20to%20test)). Indeed, if user is silent, you feed a zero tensor as user audio for that step, so the model knows “no user speech”. Similarly, if Moshi is not supposed to speak at some moment, probably a special no-output token or just not generating new tokens works. The training likely included such silent periods (explicitly or via zeros). So an implementer must decide on how to represent “no token this frame” – possibly they have a special codebook entry that corresponds to silence for acoustic tokens.

**External integration:** The final system needs audio I/O (microphone capture and speaker playback). In Python, one can use `sounddevice` or `pyaudio` for streaming audio. The Rust implementation likely handles audio I/O more robustly. But those are outside the model scope; still, for a complete system test, hooking those up is needed.

**Reproducibility:** If implementing from scratch for research, one might want to reproduce the results in the paper. That means re-training Helium on a huge dataset etc., which is extremely compute-intensive. Instead, one could take an existing pretrained LLM (like LLaMA2-7B) and fine-tune it as Helium (saving time). Similarly, one could fine-tune EnCodec as Mimi with distillation. This would drastically reduce cost to perhaps a few hundred GPU-hours instead of tens of thousands. The open source release provides weights that could be loaded to verify one’s code.

**Debugging tricky issues:** Because the model is novel, one might encounter odd issues – e.g., training might diverge (especially the GAN part for Mimi). To debug that, one can start with reconstruction loss only then introduce adversarial gradually (as they likely did baseline vs advanced in paper). Another potential issue: mismatch between training and inference processes. If the model was always trained to have some text token before audio, but at inference you do differently, you might get distribution shift. Ensuring that the generation procedure matches how training data was structured is key (including any delays or special tokens). The authors mention “we illustrate how delaying audio vs text tokens yields TTS or ASR” ([Moshi open-source release: run Moshi locally!](https://kyutai.org/2024/09/18/moshi-release.html#:~:text=An%20interesting%20byproduct%20of%20Inner,a%20streaming%20ASR%20with%20alignment)) – meaning in training they probably did experiment with various fixed delays between text and audio. Reimplementers should be mindful of those alignments.

##  Performance and Debugging Tools

- Using a profiler (like PyTorch’s autograd profiler or Nsight Systems) can identify if any part of the forward is slow. The most expensive part is Helium’s attention. If one doesn’t use FlashAttention, that could be slow for 4096 context. So integrating an efficient attention (maybe PyTorch 2’s scaled_dot_product_attention with flash enabled) is important.
- Depth Transformer is trivial by comparison; Mimi encoder/decoder are conv-heavy but 512 dims at 12.5 Hz is not too bad (some 5k length conv ops).
- If running on CPU for testing, one might disable the Depth loop and just test Helium outputs. But for final system, GPU is needed.

- Logging and visualization: Logging the waveforms or spectrograms of generated output vs reference can show if model is generating reasonable audio. For instance, one could feed a test user utterance and have Moshi respond, then check if the content of response matches expectations (maybe transcribe Moshi’s output with an external ASR to verify its word accuracy – ironically using Whisper on Moshi’s output is a good automated way to measure intelligibility and whether it’s staying on script).

In summary, implementing Moshi is a complex but tractable project: it involves combining techniques from NLP (Transformer LLMs) and Speech (neural codecs, ASR/TTS). The code will span data loading (both text and audio), multi-task training loops, and integration of different loss functions. An expert engineer would leverage existing tools as much as possible (for tokenization, base models, etc.) and only custom-build the novel bits (Depth transformer and the multi-stream data collator). Careful stepwise testing, as described, would be essential to arrive at a functioning model.
