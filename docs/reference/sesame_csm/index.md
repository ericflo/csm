# Sesame CSM Documentation

## Overview

Sesame CSM (Conversational Speech Model) is an advanced text-to-speech model developed by Sesame AI Lab that achieves remarkable "voice presence" - the feeling that a machine's voice is as genuine and engaging as a human's. Unlike traditional TTS systems that often sound flat and emotionless, CSM generates speech with natural prosody, emotion, and context-awareness suitable for interactive conversational applications.

CSM was designed to solve the central challenge of making voice AI feel present and engaged rather than robotic and detached. By understanding conversational context and history, the model can choose appropriate intonation, rhythm, and emotional tone to match the dialogue situation, creating a much more natural and engaging voice experience.

## Key Capabilities

- **Context-aware speech generation**: Adapts voice characteristics based on up to 2 minutes of conversation history
- **Emotional intelligence**: Responds appropriately to emotional cues in conversation
- **Natural prosody**: Produces speech with human-like intonation, rhythm, and emphasis
- **Multi-speaker handling**: Maintains consistent voice characteristics for each speaker
- **End-to-end approach**: Generates audio directly from text and audio context in an integrated process
- **Low latency**: Achieves ~380ms end-to-end latency on high-end GPUs
- **Voice adaptation**: Can adapt to new voices with limited samples

## Technical Specifications

- **Model architecture**: Dual-transformer framework with backbone and audio decoder
- **Parameter count**: Available in 1B, 3B, and 8B parameter backbone variants (with ~300M decoder)
- **Audio representation**: Mimi neural audio codec with semantic and acoustic tokens at 12.5 Hz
- **Training data**: 1 million hours of conversational audio with ASR transcription
- **Context window**: 2048 tokens (approximately 2 minutes of dialogue)
- **Sampling rate**: 24 kHz output audio
- **Voice presets**: Multiple built-in voice styles with consistent characteristics

## Implementation and Integration

CSM is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing natural language processing systems:

- **Open-source implementation**: 1B parameter model available on GitHub and Hugging Face
- **Python API**: Simple interface for generating speech from text and context
- **MLX acceleration**: Optimized for Apple Silicon with significant performance gains
- **Command-line tools**: Ready-to-use tools for speech generation and watermark verification
- **Watermarking technology**: Built-in audio watermarking for content verification
