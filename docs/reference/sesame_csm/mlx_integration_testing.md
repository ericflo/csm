# MLX Integration Testing Guide

This guide explains how to run the integration tests and benchmarks for the MLX training implementation in CSM (Conversational Speech Model).

## Prerequisites

To run the integration tests and benchmarks, you need:

1. Python 3.11 or higher
2. MLX installed (`pip install mlx`)
3. PyTorch installed for comparison benchmarks (optional)
4. safetensors package installed (`pip install safetensors`)
5. numpy, soundfile, and other dependencies from the CSM requirements

The tests are primarily designed for Apple Silicon hardware, but will fall back to CPU execution on other platforms.

## Running Integration Tests

The integration tests verify that the MLX training implementation works correctly from end to end, including:

1. Model loading and initialization
2. Forward and backward passes
3. Loss computation
4. Checkpoint saving/loading
5. Error handling and recovery
6. Fallback mechanisms
7. Different MLX versions compatibility

### Running the Test Suite

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m unittest discover -s src/csm/training -p "test_*.py"

# Run just the MLX integration tests
python -m unittest src.csm.training.test_mlx_integration
```

### Test Categories

The test suite includes several categories of tests:

1. `TestMLXIntegration`: End-to-end tests of the complete training pipeline
2. `TestForwardBackwardCompatibility`: Tests for version compatibility 
3. `TestBenchmarkComparison`: Basic benchmarks comparing MLX and PyTorch

### Test Requirements

- The tests create minimal models and datasets for testing
- No special hardware is required beyond what MLX itself requires
- Tests that require specific dependencies will be skipped if those dependencies are not available

## Running Benchmarks

The benchmark script provides detailed performance measurements of the MLX training implementation, and compares with PyTorch where possible.

### Basic Benchmark

```bash
# Run with tiny model
python -m csm.training.run_mlx_benchmark --tiny

# Specify output directory
python -m csm.training.run_mlx_benchmark --output-dir /path/to/results
```

### Benchmark Categories

The benchmark measures:

1. Model loading time
2. Optimizer preparation
3. Forward pass performance
4. Training step performance (forward + backward)
5. Checkpoint saving/loading performance
6. Throughput (tokens/second)
7. Matrix multiplication performance compared to PyTorch

### Benchmark Results

Results are saved as JSON files:
- `mlx_benchmark_results.json`: MLX-specific metrics
- `pytorch_comparison_results.json`: Comparison with PyTorch
- `benchmark_summary.json`: Combined results with system information

## Understanding Common Issues

### Resource Warnings

You may see `ResourceWarning` about unclosed files. These happen because:
- Some loggers keep file handlers open
- MLX may not clean up all resources in some rare conditions

These warnings can be safely ignored in most cases.

### Safetensors Compatibility

If you encounter errors related to safetensors, check:
1. The safetensors version matches the requirements
2. You have sufficient permissions to write to the output directory
3. The model path exists and is valid

### MLX Version Differences

Different versions of MLX may have different APIs, particularly:
- Optimizer interfaces may change between versions
- The internal implementation of some operations like matmul may differ
- Device handling could vary between releases

The code includes fallback mechanisms to handle most of these differences.

## Creating Custom Tests

When creating custom integration tests, follow these guidelines:

1. Always use the `@unittest.skipIf` decorator to skip tests when dependencies are missing
2. Create small models for testing to keep tests fast
3. Include robust error handling and cleanup in `tearDown` methods
4. Use placeholders for operations that might fail in some environments
5. For benchmarks, always include warm-up runs before timing
6. Group related tests into appropriate test classes

## Next Steps

After running the integration tests and benchmarks, you might want to:

1. Fine-tune a real CSM model using the verified MLX trainer
2. Implement LoRA/QLoRA with the MLX training pipeline
3. Create additional benchmarks for specific use cases
4. Optimize the MLX implementation for specific Apple Silicon processors
5. Add memory usage analysis to better understand resource requirements
