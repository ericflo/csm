The implementation of CPU-Specific Optimizations (Phase 2.5) has been completed, including:

1. SIMD-optimized vector operations with AVX/AVX2 and NEON support
2. Thread pool implementation for parallel computation
3. Cache-aware memory layout optimizations
4. Runtime CPU feature detection for selecting optimal code paths
5. Test cases demonstrating performance improvements

Previous accomplishments:
- Implementation of tokenizer module (Phase 2.3)
- SentencePiece-compatible text tokenizer
